# heat_diffusion_simulation

My project simulates the heat equation for an anisotropic homogeneous medium in two dimensions. It simulates a rectangular object surrounded by a medium, which can have a different thermal diffusivity constant. The medium is surrounded by a thermal reservoir. The thermal diffusivity of the object and the medium, the temperature of the object, medium, and reservoir, as well as the location and dimensions of the object can all be determined by the user. The reservoir will have the same thermal diffusivity constant as the medium. 

After running the code, a menu will print showing the various options to change, such as the graph length and width, object length and width, k values for both mediums, and initial heat values for the object, surrounding media, and boundaries. Typing the number and pressing enter will allow you to change each of the values. After changing a value or, to leave it in the preset values, type 'c' and enter to start the animation.
